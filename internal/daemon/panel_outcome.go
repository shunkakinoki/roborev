// classifyPanelOutcome decides a panel run's finalize outcome from its member

// attempt row exists yet). synthesis is the synthesis job's outcome as a
// ReviewResult, or nil when it is not in a failed state (done/missing).
//
// Precedence, applied in order:
//  0. synthesis failed on quota exhaustion or a transient provider outage ->
//     OutcomeDeferTransient. The consolidation step could not run, not that the
//     reviews are unusable, so wait for the real synthesis (when quota resets or
//     the provider recovers) rather than post the degraded "Synthesis
//     unavailable" raw fallback. A genuine synthesis failure is NOT caught here;
//     it falls through to the member rules below, where a member with output
//     still posts the raw fallback (retrying a deterministic error would not
//     help).
//  1. any done member with substantive output -> OutcomePost (a partial review
//     is better than nothing once any reviewer landed real output).
//  2. else any transient-outage or quota/session failure ->
//     OutcomeDeferTransient (wait for the real review rather than post a
//     failed/partial result).
//  3. else any genuine failure -> OutcomeGenuineGiveUp when this attempt would
//     hit the give-up cap (consecutiveGenuine+1), otherwise OutcomeDeferGenuine.
//  4. else (all timeout skips, or empty) -> OutcomeAllSkip.
