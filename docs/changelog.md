description: Release history for roborev
---

All notable changes to roborev, grouped by minor release.

## Unreleased

**Improvements**

- Default Agent Hook autofix reminders now keep the user's current task as an
    immutable scope boundary, name exact review job IDs, and invoke only the
    bundled `roborev-fix` skill. They never run `roborev fix --open` or discover
    additional reviews. Custom instructions remain complete overrides.
- The bundled `roborev-fix` skills now require agents to prove every finding
    against current code before editing. Invalid reviews are documented and
    closed without code changes; valid out-of-scope findings remain open for
    user direction.
- `roborev agent-hook install` now installs or updates bundled skills
    automatically for Claude Code, Codex, Factory Droid, and Grok Build.

**Bug fixes**

- Agent Hook remembers delivered review IDs per agent session and repository
    lineage, preventing repeated reminders for the same reviews while allowing
    newly created reviews to trigger. Deferred reminders acknowledge IDs only
    when they are delivered.

## 0.66.0

<small>2026-08-22</small>

**New features**

- Trusted-proxy authentication lets private-network deployments delegate browser
    admission to an external HTTPS proxy. Set `web.auth_mode = "proxy"` to
    create restricted remote sessions without a Roborev token after the daemon
    validates the request origin and forwarding shape. Existing local and token
    authentication remain unchanged. See
    [Proxy Authentication](/web-ui/#proxy-authentication).
- Set `web.base_path` to host the browser application below a URL path prefix.
    Roborev applies the prefix to server routes, browser navigation, assets,
    deep links, API calls, event streams, and session cookies. The prefix
    provides routing, not same-origin isolation. See
    [Private Network Access](/web-ui/#private-network-access).
- Global autofix guidelines. Set `fix_guidelines` in `~/.roborev/config.toml` to
    give every Agent Hook profile and foreground `roborev fix` agent policy for
    evaluating review findings, including when a suggestion should be verified
    or intentionally not applied. Existing automatic behavior remains unchanged
    when the setting is empty. See
    [Fix Guidelines](/configuration/#fix-guidelines).
- Agent Hook now uses the regular Roborev daemon for event handling, session
    inspection, and resets. The daemon reuses existing counters from
    `${ROBOREV_DATA_DIR:-~/.roborev}/agent-hook/state.json`; no second daemon is
    started. Before upgrading from a release with the auxiliary daemon, stop it
    with that release's `roborev agent-hook daemon stop` command. See
    [Upgrading existing hooks](/agent-hook/#upgrading-existing-hooks).

**Improvements**

- `roborev update` now coordinates daemon replacement with active reviews.
    Choose whether to wait, requeue interrupted attempts, or abort; new jobs
    remain queued until the replacement daemon is responsive and reports the
    installed version. See [Update](/commands/#update).
- The daemon retries fresh token-cost misses and periodically revisits eligible
    terminal jobs from the previous week that still lack pricing. Missing prices
    remain durable retry work across daemon restarts, while older jobs remain
    available to `roborev backfill-tokens`. See
    [Cost Usage Endpoint](/configuration/#cost-usage-endpoint).
- Daemon status, restart, UI, and version commands now explain whether the
    browser UI was disabled by configuration or omitted from the build. Release
    verification also checks published archives for the embedded production web
    application. See [Open the Application](/web-ui/#open-the-application).
- Security reviews now exclude established low-value finding classes, state a
    precision-first posture, and compare changed code with the codebase's
    established secure pattern before reporting a deviation.
- Development, CI, release, screenshot, Nix, and CodeQL builds now use Go 1.27.
    Published binaries remain self-contained. See
    [Build from Source](/installation/#build-from-source).
- Go dependencies were refreshed. The indirect `grpc-go` dependency was upgraded
    to 1.82.1, outside the range affected by `GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf`.

**Bug fixes**

- Daemon-free CI posts forge comments only when a completed agent run produced
    nonempty review output. Agent startup and installation errors stay local
    instead of becoming erroneous pull or merge request comments.
- Jobs fail promptly when the direct agent process exits with an error, even if
    a descendant still holds an output descriptor open. Successful output
    remains complete, and unread buffered output is bounded.
- Streamed Grok `thought` and `reasoning` fragments are assembled into complete
    reasoning blocks instead of rendering each fragment as a separate terminal
    row.

## 0.65.0

<small>2026-08-16</small>

**New features**

- Roborev now embeds an authenticated native browser review workspace on a
    separate daemon listener. `roborev ui [job-id]` opens the job list or a
    review deep link with filtering, sorting, panel detail, Markdown output,
    comments, logs, prompts, keyboard controls, and review/job mutations. Local
    use bootstraps automatically; remote HTTPS deployments exchange a token for
    a browser session without exposing the private CLI listener. Analytics
    reports review volume, outcomes, errors, latency, agent attempts, estimated
    cost, and pricing coverage. See [Browser UI](/web-ui/).
- The TUI automatically shows a kata-style split-screen review workspace on
    terminals at least 140 columns by 36 rows. The queue drives a live detail
    pane for completed, running, failed, and queued jobs; `L` toggles layouts,
    and smaller terminals fall back to the existing stacked view. See
    [Split-Screen Review](/integrations/tui/#split-screen-review).
- Reasoning accepts exact `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` values and
    forwards them unchanged to agents that support each tier. The legacy `fast`,
    `standard`, `thorough`, and `maximum` presets remain compatible. See
    [Reasoning Levels](/configuration/#reasoning-levels).
- Pi agents accept global `[agent.pi] launch_args`, passed as tokenized
    arguments to every Pi invocation before roborev-managed workflow and safety
    options. This allows isolated classifier jobs to load extension-defined
    model providers explicitly while retaining `--no-extensions` discovery
    isolation. See [Pi Classifier Options](/configuration/#pi-classifier-options).
- `roborev export ci-costs` exports job-level costs for eligible CI attempts,
    including terminal retries that panel summaries cannot retain. Stable
    cursors, overlapping-window refreshes, null-versus-zero pricing, and a
    legacy backfill mode support incremental downstream accounting. See
    [Exporting CI Costs](/commands/#exporting-ci-costs).

**Improvements**

- `roborev daemon start`, `roborev daemon restart`, and the new canonical
    `roborev daemon status` command print the browser application's URL, or an
    explicit unavailable state when browser serving is disabled. The existing
    `roborev status` form remains available with identical output, and JSON
    status includes the additive `web_url` field.
- `roborev status` now lists active Agent Hook snoozes with their exact
    repository, worktree, branch, and expiry, while the TUI shows a contextual
    snooze badge for an exactly filtered checkout. See
    [Snoozing Reminders](/agent-hook/#snoozing-reminders).
- Daemon restarts stop new claims and wait for active reviews, hooks, and final
    sync to finish before starting the replacement process. The CLI reports the
    wait instead of force-killing work after a fixed timeout.
- `roborev review --branch` now resolves the repository and range from the
    linked worktree that invoked it, preventing shared or stale Git
    configuration from redirecting the review to a sibling checkout. See
    [Git Worktrees](/guides/repository-management/#git-worktrees).
- Agent Hook installation and runtime handling now use kit's shared coding-agent
    profiles. One workflow supports Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, Cursor,
    Factory Droid, Gemini CLI, Hermes, and Qwen, while Roborev retains its Grok
    integration. Existing Codex, Claude, and Droid registrations can be upgraded
    in place. See [Agent Hook](/agent-hook/).
- The Homebrew tap now discovers official Roborev releases and owns formula
    updates, removing duplicate publisher logic and the cross-repository release
    credential. See
    [Homebrew installation](/installation/#homebrew-macos-linux).
- Development, CI, release, and screenshot builds now require Go 1.26.6. Go,
    JavaScript, documentation, and GitHub Actions dependencies were refreshed,
    including fixes for known Go toolchain and `go-git` vulnerabilities.

**Bug fixes**

- Browser clients now preserve the newest job state when list requests overlap
    live events, and cancellations and comments refresh other open clients.
- Remote browser sessions can cancel ordinary non-agentic reviews but cannot
    rerun jobs. Session expiry and logout now close active browser streams.
- Persisted job output is shown only when its log belongs to the current
    attempt, so a failed rerun cannot fall back to an older attempt's output.
- Daemon discovery now preserves sandbox permission failures instead of treating
    an unreachable loopback or Unix socket as proof that no daemon exists.
    Clients can use the daemon's private Unix-socket fallback without starting a
    competing process. See [Daemon & Hooks](/commands/#daemon-hooks).
- Fresh agent sessions now receive a short, bounded agentsview usage-indexing
    retry before Roborev falls back to job-log token data, reducing permanently
    missing cost estimates. See [Token Usage](/commands/#token-usage).
- The Codex `maximum` preset now requests literal `max` for explicit GPT-5.6
    `sol`, `terra`, and `luna` models. Older, default, and unknown models retain
    the compatible `xhigh` mapping, while exact `xhigh` remains distinct.

    upgrade.

## 0.64.0

<small>2026-08-06</small>

**New features**

- `roborev ci review` can review GitLab merge requests in GitLab CI, resolve
    merge request ranges automatically, and create or update MR notes. It also
    supports self-managed GitLab hosts and explicit project, host, and MR
    selection. See [GitLab Integration](/integrations/gitlab/).
- [Grok Build](https://x.ai/cli) is now a first-class agent under `--agent grok`
    (alias `grok-build`), with streamed output, session resume, structured
    classification, agentic jobs, bundled skills, and Agent Hook support.
    Reviews use layered read-only restrictions, while agentic work continues to
    require the unsafe-agent opt-in. See [Grok Build](/agents/#grok-build).
- ACP configuration now supports multiple named agents through `[acp.<name>]`
    subtables. Repository entries replace only the matching global agent, and
    commands, models, backups, CI jobs, and synthesis remain isolated by name.
    The ACP guide includes an end-to-end Goose example using ChatGPT Codex
    subscription authentication. This is a breaking configuration change:
    migrate `[acp]` plus `name = "foo"` to `[acp.foo]`. See
    [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](/advanced/acp/).
- `roborev snooze` temporarily silences Agent Hook reminders for the current
    repository, linked worktree, and branch without pausing review enqueueing or
    processing. Bundled Claude Code, Codex, and Factory Droid skills expose the
    same workflow. See [Snoozing Reminders](/agent-hook/#snoozing-reminders).
- `roborev skills install --path <directory>` installs a selected bundled skill
    variant into a custom final skills directory, supporting agents such as Pi
    whose personal skill paths roborev does not auto-detect. See
    [Agent Skills](/guides/agent-skills/).
- PostgreSQL sync passwords can use `${file:/absolute/path}` references in
    `postgres_url`, keeping credentials out of the TOML file and making them
    available to daemons that do not inherit the operator's environment. See
    [Credential Expansion](/advanced/postgres-sync/#credential-expansion).

**Improvements**

- Agent Hook Stop reminders now tell the coding agent to resume its interrupted
    task after addressing roborev findings, preserving multi-turn work that had
    paused at a specification, approval, or implementation checkpoint.
- Repositories with no configured `review_guidelines` now fall back to a
    repository-root `REVIEW.md`. Configured guidelines still take precedence,
    and commit/range reviews read the fallback from the default branch to
    prevent the reviewed change from rewriting its own policy. See
    [Review Guidelines](/configuration/#review-guidelines).
- `roborev check-agents` now honors configured agent command overrides, so its
    smoke tests exercise the same wrapper or binary as actual jobs.
- Concurrent post-commit hooks now coalesce identical automatic review requests
    by repository, resolved Git ref, and review target. Explicit review commands
    still enqueue fresh work. See
    [Post-Commit Reviews](/automation/post-commit-reviews/).
- CI synthesis summaries that explicitly report a passing review now produce a
    passing verdict, while structured severity findings continue to take
    precedence as failures.
- Metadata job listings no longer hydrate completed-job prompts and review
    outputs that callers do not use, substantially reducing daemon response size
    and transient memory use. Active-job prompts remain available to the TUI.
- Review prompts now discourage test recommendations that merely search source
    text or mirror constants, and instead require observable behavior,
    invariants, failure modes, or integration boundaries.

**Bug fixes**

- Fresh review sessions briefly retry missing agentsview usage lookups, avoiding
    permanently token-only jobs when indexing finishes just after the review.
- CLI output now renders commit ranges as two shortened refs separated by `..`
    instead of truncating the range into a value that looks like one commit.
- `roborev show --prompt <job_id>` can read the stored prompt while a job is
    still queued or running.
- The TUI displays `(detached @ <shortsha>)` for branchless detached-HEAD commit
    reviews instead of leaving the Branch column blank.
- Token backfill and cost displays now accept agentsview v0.39.0's
    `cost.microdollars` format while remaining compatible with the older
    `cost_usd` field.
- Empty Antigravity review runs now fail and engage retry or backup-agent
    handling instead of being recorded as completed placeholder reviews. See
    [Gemini: Antigravity vs Legacy CLI](/agents/#gemini-antigravity-vs-legacy-cli).

## 0.63.0

<small>2026-07-16</small>

**New features**

- CI quiet hours add a recurring daily window with an additional per-PR review
    throttle. Configure `[ci.quiet_hours]` with `start`, `end`, `timezone`, and
    `throttle_interval`; the additional interval applies by default even to
    authors listed in `[ci].throttle_bypass_users`. See
    [Quiet Hours](/integrations/github/#quiet-hours).
- `[ci.quiet_hours].bypass_users` lets selected GitHub authors skip only the
    additional quiet-hours interval. Authors who should bypass both throttle
    layers must also appear in `[ci].throttle_bypass_users`. See
    [Quiet Hours Options](/integrations/github/#quiet-hours-options).
- `roborev run --json` emits one machine-readable launch receipt with `job_id`,
    `job_uuid`, `git_ref`, and `status`. Skipped enqueues emit a
    machine-readable reason instead, allowing automation to distinguish a
    successful launch from a policy skip without parsing human output. See
    [Custom Tasks & Agentic Mode](/advanced/custom-tasks/).

**Improvements**

- The bundled `roborev-fix` skills now distinguish current operative invocations
    and direct Agent Hook instructions from literal skill syntax inside pasted
    findings, logs, transcripts, quotations, and examples, preventing historical
    text from unexpectedly starting a roborev workflow. See
    [Agent Skills](/guides/agent-skills/#usage).

**Bug fixes**

- Review enqueues from detached-HEAD checkouts now infer an unambiguous local
    branch from the target commit, restoring branch-scoped TUI grouping,
    fix/refine discovery, and hook matching for tooling-managed worktrees.
    Ambiguous matches still remain branchless, and inferred branches continue to
    honor `excluded_branches`. See
    [Detached HEAD Worktrees](/guides/repository-management/#detached-head-worktrees).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for CI quiet-hours
    throttling and bypass controls, machine-readable task launch receipts, safer
    `roborev-fix` trigger boundaries, and detached-HEAD branch inference.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.62.1

<small>2026-07-13</small>

**New features**

- Completed CI panel metrics are now persisted at finalization, including
    terminal outcome, retry timing, and synthesis agent/model snapshots.
    `roborev export ci-metrics` exports those records with member and synthesis
    job timing, opaque resumable cursors, database-reset detection, and an
    optional `--legacy` backfill for pre-panel CI history. See
    [Exporting CI Metrics](/commands/#exporting-ci-metrics).
- `roborev version --json` provides a stable machine-readable contract with the
    canonical tool name and build version. See
    [Version JSON Contract](/commands/#version-json-contract).

**Improvements**

- The TUI Prompt view now wraps the full agent command by default, while the Log
    view keeps its compact single-line default. Press `i` to toggle each view
    independently. See [Prompt View](/integrations/tui/#prompt-view).
- The Codex `roborev-fix` skill remains model-invocable so Agent Hook can start
    the requested fix loop; every other bundled Codex skill remains
    explicit-only. See [Agent Skills](/guides/agent-skills/#usage).
- The Nix flake no longer depends on `flake-utils`, reducing transitive flake
    inputs while preserving the supported system outputs.

**Bug fixes**

- ACP backup agents no longer inherit a backup model paired with a different
    agent. A mismatched inherited model is skipped so the selected ACP agent
    keeps its own `[acp].model` instead of failing model validation. See
    [Backup Agents](/configuration/#backup-agents).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for persistent CI panel
    metrics and export, wrapped TUI prompt commands, and Codex Agent Hook skill
    invocation.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for the
    stable JSON version contract.
- Thanks to [Matthew Jacobs](https://github.com/mjacobs) for ACP backup-model
    pairing safeguards and expanded Gemini ACP documentation.
- Thanks to [Luis Quiñones](https://github.com/luisnquin) for simplifying the
    Nix flake dependencies.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.62.0

<small>2026-07-11</small>

**New features**

- `roborev cancel <job_id>` cancels one queued or running job from the command
    line. Terminal jobs cannot be canceled. See
    [Canceling a Job](/commands/#canceling-a-job).

**Improvements**

- Bundled Codex and Claude Code roborev skills now require explicit user
    invocation. Personal, plugin-namespaced, and structured Codex selection
    remain available, as do Claude Code slash commands and menu selection;
    ordinary review or fix requests stay in the agent's native workflow. See
    [Agent Skills](/guides/agent-skills/#usage).
- `roborev skills install`, skill status checks, updates, and agent-hook
    installation now honor `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME`, falling back to
    `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` when the variables are unset. See
    [Agent Skills](/guides/agent-skills/#how-it-works).
- ACP documentation now includes model-selectable Gemini setup through an
    Antigravity SDK bridge, thinking-level model suffixes, daemon environment
    injection, and troubleshooting for agent and model selection. See
    [Model-Selectable Gemini via a Bridge](/advanced/acp/#example-model-selectable-gemini-via-a-bridge).

**Bug fixes**

- Workflow-specific models no longer leak into a selected ACP agent when the
    model is paired with a different workflow agent. The selected ACP agent
    instead keeps its `[acp].model`; explicit `--model` values and models paired
    with that ACP agent still take precedence.
- The Antigravity adapter now selects the prompt transport supported by the
    installed `agy` version: stdin-based `--print` through 1.1.0 and `--prompt`
    starting with 1.1.1.
- Pre-commit lint checks now use the non-mutating `make lint-ci` target,
    preventing commits from unexpectedly rewriting files. `make lint` remains
    the explicit auto-fix command.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Matthew Jacobs](https://github.com/mjacobs) for `roborev cancel`,
    the model-selectable Gemini ACP documentation, and ACP model-pairing fixes.
- Thanks to [Yo Iida](https://github.com/y011d4) for honoring custom Claude Code
    and Codex configuration directories during skill installation.
- Thanks to [Graham Taylor](https://github.com/gwtaylor) for Antigravity version
    compatibility.
- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for explicit-only Codex and
    Claude Code skills and non-mutating pre-commit lint checks.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.61.2

<small>2026-07-04</small>

**New features**

- TUI queue panel rows now show wall-clock elapsed time from the first reviewer
    start through synthesis completion, so collapsed panels reflect the
    end-to-end wait instead of only synthesis runtime.

**Improvements**

- Metadata-only job listings can omit prompt and diff payloads, reducing daemon
    and agent-hook response sizes while avoiding unnecessary prompt exposure in
    callers that only need job state.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for TUI panel wall-clock
    elapsed time.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for slimmer
    metadata-only job listings that omit prompt payloads.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.61.1

<small>2026-07-02</small>

**New features**

- Incremental review export cursors. `roborev export reviews` now emits a stable
    `database_id` and opaque `next_cursor` values, and `--cursor` resumes
    strictly after a previous export position for consumers that sync only new
    completed review data. See
    [Exporting Reviews](/commands/#exporting-reviews).

**Improvements**

- Documentation deployments now publish source Markdown files next to rendered
    pages, so `/changelog.md`, `/index.md`, and nav-listed page sources can be
    read directly by agents and other programmatic consumers.
- CI review comments now use numbered reviewer labels and aggregate
    reviewer-status footers instead of exposing internal panel member/type
    identifiers, making PR comments cleaner for downstream review and fix
    workflows.
- Refine documentation now points users to Agent Hook when they want Codex or
    Claude Code sessions to pick up review fixes automatically. See
    [Auto-Fix with Refine](/guides/auto-fixing/).

**Bug fixes**

- Deferred transient CI review attempts are made due when the daemon starts, so
    provider outages or quota cooldowns that outlive a daemon restart can be
    retried immediately instead of waiting on stale in-memory backoff state.
- Review enqueue metadata collection now uses a single go-git reader for safe
    metadata reads with subprocess fallback for unsupported repository formats,
    improving reliability and latency for hook-triggered reviews, especially on
    Windows.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Wes McKinney](https://github.com/wesm) for incremental review
    export cursors, public Markdown source publishing, CI review comment
    metadata improvements, and CI startup retry recovery.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for the
    refine documentation update and more reliable review enqueue metadata
    collection.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.61.0

<small>2026-06-30</small>

**New features**

- Completed review export. `roborev export reviews` emits completed review
    history as JSON, with `content` and `metadata` profiles plus date, repo,
    project, closed-only, and limit filters. Panel synthesis reviews export as
    top-level rows with completed member reviews nested under `subagents`. See
    [Exporting Reviews](/commands/#exporting-reviews).
- Lookahead reviews. `roborev review --type lookahead` adds a time-series
    correctness reviewer focused on look-ahead bias, future-data leakage,
    point-in-time joins, temporal split mistakes, and related peekahead defects.
    See [Review Types](/guides/reviewing-code/#review-types).
- Factory Droid support for the agent-hook and skill workflows.
    `roborev agent-hook install --agent droid` installs user-scoped Factory
    Droid hooks, and roborev now ships Droid-compatible review, fix, refine,
    respond, design-review, and lookahead skill files, plus their branch
    variants. See [Agent Hook](/agent-hook/).
- Per-analysis agent configuration. Analysis types can now pin their own agent,
    model, and reasoning with `[analyze.<type>]`, so `roborev analyze refactor`
    and similar workflows can use analysis-specific defaults. See
    [Workflow-Specific Agent and Model](/configuration/#workflow-specific-agent-and-model).
- CI Discord failure notifications. `[ci] discord_webhook_url` enables
    best-effort Discord webhook alerts for CI review job failures, with
    sensitive URL masking in config output. See
    [CI Options Reference](/integrations/github/#ci-options-reference).

**Improvements**

- Post-commit hook request timeouts are now configurable with
    `hook_timeout_seconds`, with Windows defaulting to 30 seconds and other
    platforms defaulting to 3 seconds. The hook resolves repo config without
    spawning git, so large repos and Windows checkouts can raise the bound
    without adding more hook latency.
- `roborev update` now allows slower release downloads and repairs registered
    roborev-managed git hooks after an update so managed installs keep pointing
    hooks at the new binary.
- Documentation now covers `[analyze.<type>]` configuration for fieldless review
    types such as `lookahead`.

**Bug fixes**

- PostgreSQL sync now sanitizes invalid UTF-8 and NUL bytes in job text fields
    such as prompts, diffs, and errors before writing to Postgres, preventing
    binary review data from breaking sync.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.60.0

<small>2026-06-25</small>

**New features**

- `roborev quickstart` now provides guided setup and automation onboarding for
    repository setup, review tuning, and post-commit review workflows.
- Codex jobs now support explicit `-c` config passthrough overrides through
    `[agent.codex.config]`, so teams can opt into custom Codex providers without
    loading the full user config. See
    [Custom Codex Config](/configuration/#custom-codex-config-model-providers).

**Improvements**

- Onboarding docs now center automation-first workflows, including post-commit
    reviews, agent hooks, review tuning, and agent-oriented setup guidance.
- Git hook and agent hook installers now prefer managed `roborev` shims when
    available, keeping generated hook commands stable across version-manager
    upgrades.

**Bug fixes**

- `roborev refine` now rejects dirty or changed submodule state before applying
    agent output, avoiding accidental overwrite of local submodule edits.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.59.2

<small>2026-06-24</small>

**New features**

- Copilot review output now prefers structured JSON when the installed CLI
    supports it, so roborev can store complete assistant findings instead of
    truncated process output.
- `roborev fix` now includes completed `analyze` jobs when discovering open
    findings, so queued analysis results can be fixed without passing each job
    ID explicitly. See
    [Applying Fixes from Analysis](/guides/assisted-refactoring/#applying-fixes-from-analysis).

**Improvements**

- Homebrew tap updates now open pull requests against `kenn-io/homebrew-tap`
    instead of pushing directly to the protected tap branch.
- Workflow-configured reviews, fixes, panels, CI members, and synthesis now use
    only the preferred agent or an explicitly configured backup. See
    [Backup Agents](/configuration/#backup-agents).
- `roborev analyze` agent invocation is more stable across local setups,
    including Gemini/Antigravity selection, capability probes from deleted
    worktrees, and Codex stored-prompt jobs.

**Bug fixes**

- Quota-only or provider-unavailable panel runs no longer store misleading
    failed synthesis reviews when every member was skipped for availability
    reasons.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.59.1

<small>2026-06-22</small>

**New features**

- Configurable fix commit metadata. Set `fix_commit_author` and
    `fix_commit_co_authored_by` globally or per repo to control author metadata
    for `roborev refine` commits, background fix commits applied from the TUI,
    and prompt instructions for foreground `roborev fix` and
    `roborev analyze --fix` commits. See
    [Fix Commit Metadata](/configuration/#fix-commit-metadata).
- Tolerated panel member failures. Mark a panel subagent with
    `allow_failure = true` when that reviewer is useful but flaky, so a
    transient failure or cancellation does not fail an otherwise usable panel
    result. See [Subagents](/advanced/subagent-review-panels/#subagents).

**Improvements**

- Pi job logs now render trace-style message and tool output instead of exposing
    raw event JSON, making Pi review sessions easier to inspect in CLI and TUI
    logs.
- Panel parent rows and CI comment footers now surface known member costs even
    when some panel work is still pending or unpriced, with partial coverage
    clearly marked where comments include costs.
- Expanded documentation for configuration, GitHub integration, review
    workflows, auto-fix/refine workflows, and subagent review panels.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.59.0

<small>2026-06-22</small>

**New features**

- Repository-hosted documentation. The roborev.io docs now live in this
    repository, with guides, command reference, integration docs,
    troubleshooting, and a local Zensical build/check workflow. See
    [Docs Maintainer Guide](/development/#documentation).
- Global review guidelines. Set `review_guidelines` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`
    to apply shared reviewer instructions across repositories. Repo-level
    `review_guidelines` are appended after the global text by default; set
    `review_guidelines_supersede_global = true` in `.roborev.toml` when a repo
    should replace the global guidance. See
    [Review Guidelines](/configuration/#review-guidelines).
- Hook-only auto-design routing. `[auto_design_review] hook_enabled = true` runs
    the design-review router for post-commit hook reviews without also enabling
    it for manual reviews or CI. See
    [Auto Design Review](/configuration/#auto-design-review).

**Improvements**

- `roborev status` is more responsive because it no longer performs slow
    repository config probes while rendering status.
- CLI startup is faster because terminal capability probing is no longer
    imported during startup.
- CI review retries keep using the agents configured for the PR instead of being
    derailed by daemon quota cooldowns.
- Agent quota cooldowns can now be capped with `agent_quota_cooldown`, a global
    Go-duration config value that defaults to `30m`.
- CI review worktrees are grouped under repo-named parent directories, making
    daemon clone/worktree storage easier to inspect.
- Security review prompts are stricter about reporting only concrete,
    exploitable issues and avoiding generic low-signal findings.
- Agent-hook continuation prompts now tell the agent to fix roborev issues and
    then continue the interrupted task, reducing session derailment.
- Self-update and install release discovery are more resilient when GitHub API
    rate limits are hit.

**Bug fixes**

- Hidden Windows console windows for daemon, git, and agent child processes.
- Fixed Windows summary filtering behavior.
- Fixed Codex token usage backfill and reporting.
- Fixed `check-agents` availability checks so configured command overrides such
    as `codex_cmd` and `claude_code_cmd` are honored.
- Improved `roborev fix` discovery so it targets failing reviews and follows
    hook lineage correctly, including branchless and detached-head flows.

**Acknowledgements**

    faster `status`, lighter CLI startup, capped quota cooldowns, CI

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.58

<small>2026-06-11</small>

**New features**

- Kata integration. Local reviews can include task context from a repo's bound
    Kata project, either from the Kata issues referenced in reviewed commit
    messages or from the open Kata backlog. Review hooks can also file failed
    reviews and review findings back into Kata. See
    [Kata Integration](/configuration/#kata-integration) and
    [Built-in: Kata Integration](/guides/hooks/#built-in-kata-integration).
- Branch filtering for review hooks. Add `branches = ["main", "release/*"]` to a
    `[[hooks]]` entry to run it only for matching branches. Local reviews match
    the job branch; CI PR reviews match the PR base branch so protected-branch
    workflows can target `main` or release branches. See
    [Branch Filtering](/guides/hooks/#branch-filtering).
- Queue pause and resume controls. `roborev pause`, `roborev unpause`, and the
    TUI `P` shortcut pause queue processing without canceling running jobs.
    Queued jobs remain queued until the queue is resumed. See
    [Queue Pause](/integrations/tui/#queue-pause).
- Aggregate review cost tracking. `roborev cost` shows approximate all-time or
    scoped agent spend, and `roborev summary` now includes windowed cost
    coverage. See [Aggregate Cost](/commands/#aggregate-cost).
- Public daemon Go client. External integrations can import
    `go.kenn.io/roborev/pkg/client` for a typed client generated from the daemon
    OpenAPI contract, with raw helpers for streaming/log endpoints. See
    [Public Go Client](/advanced/streaming/#public-go-client).
- Binary overrides for agent hooks. `roborev agent-hook install --binary <path>`
    bakes a stable roborev shim or explicit binary path into Codex and Claude
    Code hook configs, mirroring the git-hook `roborev init --binary` workflow.
    See [Agent Hook installation](/agent-hook/#install).

**Improvements**

- Preserve user `safe.directory` Git config when running with Git config
    isolation.
- TUI queue and status displays now surface paused queues with a persistent
    `[PAUSED]` marker and show approximate aggregate cost for the active filter
    scope.
- CI panel synthesis now defers and retries on quota or transient synthesis
    failures instead of posting degraded raw member output.
- Pi classifier setup guidance now explicitly points users at the JSON schema
    extension install step. See
    [Pi Structured Output](/agents/#pi-structured-output).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed Windows daemon restart failures.
- Prevented unwanted Windows console pop-ups when starting daemon and
    process-management commands.
- Improved Windows daemon/process cleanup behavior.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for queue
    pause controls, the generated public daemon client, agent-hook binary
    overrides, preserving user `safe.directory` config, Windows daemon/process
    fixes, and clearer Pi classifier extension setup guidance.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.57.1

<small>2026-06-08</small>

**New features**

- Ship Windows releases as both `.zip` and `.tar.gz` archives.
- Add a daemon route for agentsview token backfill.

**Improvements**

- Improve TUI queue rendering performance.
- Speed up TUI queue startup by reducing repeated display-name lookups.
- Reduce git command overhead on Windows ARM systems.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix PowerShell 5.x install failures on Windows when handling redirects.
- Fix TUI freezes when using multi-repo filters.
- Allow agentsview usage without version-gating.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.57

<small>2026-06-05</small>

**New features**

- Agent hook integration. The new `roborev agent-hook` command plugs into Codex
    and Claude Code harness hooks and prompts the agent to run `$roborev-fix`
    once review work piles up, so reviews get fixed inside the agent session.
    See [Agent Hook](/agent-hook/).
- Subagent review panels for CI and manual daemon reviews. A panel fans one
    review target out to named reviewer specs, then produces one synthesis
    parent review that is the actionable row for `show`, `list`, `wait`, fix
    workflows, and the TUI. CI now uses the same panel system; existing
    `agents`, `review_types`, and `[ci.reviews]` configs become an implicit
    panel when `[ci] panel` is not set. See
    [Subagent Review Panels](/advanced/subagent-review-panels/) and
    [Named CI Panels](/integrations/github/#named-ci-panels).
- Safer CI review retries. The CI poller now tracks retry state per PR HEAD,
    defers transient provider outages without posting misleading comments,
    retries genuine member failures up to a bounded cap, and rechecks PR open
    state, HEAD SHA, and repo identity before retrying or posting. See
    [Safe CI Retries](/integrations/github/#safe-ci-retries).
- Anonymous daemon telemetry. roborev sends limited anonymous daemon lifecycle
    telemetry on startup and once every 24 hours while running, with repo and
    review counts plus high-level feature flags. It does not send repo names,
    paths, remotes, prompts, review output, provider tokens, usernames, or IP
    geolocation. Disable with `ROBOREV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` or
    `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0`. See [Telemetry](/configuration/#telemetry).
- DEB and RPM release artifacts. Linux releases now include `.deb` and `.rpm`
    packages for `amd64` and `arm64`, including user-level systemd units. See
    [Linux Packages](/installation/#linux-packages-deb-and-rpm).

**Improvements**

- TUI review and queue panel refinements, plus a new `i` toggle in log and
    prompt views that expands or collapses the full command line used for a job.
    See [Terminal UI](/integrations/tui/#log-view).
- `compact` now requires the consolidated review to repeat each remaining
    finding with actionable detail (severity, file/line, description). Outputs
    that report findings only as counts or summaries are rejected instead of
    stored, so a compacted review cannot claim findings it never lists. Clean
    verifications are unaffected. See
    [Consolidating Reviews](/commands/#consolidating-reviews).
- Cost lookup can be routed through a configurable HTTP usage endpoint instead
    of the local `agentsview` CLI. See
    [Cost Usage Endpoint](/configuration/#cost-usage-endpoint).
- Update discovery now uses GitHub's HTML redirect endpoint for latest release
    checks, avoiding GitHub API rate limits.
- Raised the default CI `batch_timeout` from 3 minutes to 15 minutes. Set
    `batch_timeout = "0"` to disable. See
    [CI Options Reference](/integrations/github/#ci-options-reference).
- Improved dependency metadata filtering to reduce false-positive findings.
- Default review prompts now put `No issues found.` on its own line for cleaner
    pass output.
- Improved classifier support, including Pi schema-based classifier output
    through the configured JSON schema extension. See
    [Pi Classifier Options](/configuration/#pi-classifier-options).

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed CI reviews using stale checkouts.
- Fixed worktrees finding `.roborev.toml` when it is gitignored in the main
    repo.
- Fixed review retry log handling and retained classifier job logs.
- Fixed Claude classifier structured output parsing.
- Fixed hook binary resolution for managed installs.
- Fixed the OpenCode install source. See
    [Supported Agents](/agents/#supported-agents).
- Fixed Copilot streaming behavior when the agent supports disabling streaming.
- Grounded reviewer version checks in the project toolchain.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.56

<small>2026-05-24</small>

**New features**

- Per-job cost estimate in the TUI queue. A new default-visible "Cost" column
    shows the agentsview-provided cost estimate alongside the existing token
    counts; the review detail header appends `· ~$0.42` to the usage summary.
    Cost data requires agentsview 0.30.0 or newer (which adds
    `agentsview session usage <id> --format json` with `cost_usd`/`has_cost`
    fields); on older versions the column stays blank and token counts are
    unaffected. Run `roborev backfill-tokens` to refresh existing jobs once
    agentsview is upgraded. See [Token Usage](/commands/#token-usage).
- Agent plugin manifests for Claude Code and Codex. The repository now ships
    `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
    `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` pointing at the same Claude and Codex skill
    trees that `roborev skills install` uses. This lets users install roborev
    skills through each agent's plugin distribution channel in addition to the
    existing CLI installer.
- Repo-local oversized-diff snapshots. The default snapshot root moves from OS
    temp space to `.roborev/` under the repo, set per-repo via a new
    `snapshot_dir` field in `.roborev.toml`. `roborev init` ensures the
    configured directory is ignored in `.gitignore`; snapshot creation also
    writes a local `.git/info/exclude` fallback for repos whose ignore setup is
    stale. `snapshot_dir` must be a relative path under the repo root and may
    not be inside `.git`. See
    [Prompt Size Budget](/configuration/#prompt-size-budget).

**Improvements**

- Prefer the Antigravity `agy` CLI for the Gemini agent. Google has deprecated
    the legacy `gemini` CLI; roborev now picks `agy` first when both are
    installed and falls back to `gemini` otherwise. Antigravity runs in
    `--print` mode with prompts piped over stdin and maps review/agentic
    permissions to `--sandbox` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Antigravity
    does not yet accept a `--model` flag, so model overrides automatically
    reroute to `gemini` if it is installed; when only `agy` is available, an
    explicit `--model` returns a clear error instead of being silently ignored.
    See [Supported Agents](/agents/#supported-agents).
- Design review prompt gains an "Internal contradictions" check as the new
    top-priority item. This flags places where two parts of a spec, PRD, or task
    list conflict even when each part is individually clear, so downstream
    agents do not resolve the conflict differently and produce inconsistent
    implementations. The original five-bullet rubric (completeness, feasibility,
    task scoping, missing considerations, clarity) is preserved as items 2
    through 6.
- CLI errors no longer dump the full usage block on runtime failures. The usage
    block now prints for invocation errors only (unknown flags, mutually
    exclusive flags, bad enum values, unknown subcommands, invalid `--server`);
    runtime errors (daemon down, invalid git ref, network failure) print just
    `Error: ...`. Caller-controlled exits (`review --wait` with a Fail verdict,
    `wait` with multiple jobs) remain silent with the correct exit code.
    `--quiet` continues to silence the verdict output but still surfaces runtime
    error messages, matching CLI convention.
- The `/roborev-fix` skills for Claude Code and Codex now require closing each
    addressed review before handling any post-fix auto-reviews, and add explicit
    per-job `closed=true` audit guidance so the skill cannot leave reviews open
    after applying fixes.

**Bug fixes**

- Retry backoff is now enforced per job rather than per worker. A new
    `retry_not_before` column on `review_jobs` (added by a SQLite migration and
    the postgres v13 schema) stamps the earliest claim time when a job is
    retried, and `ClaimJob` filters on it across the entire worker pool. The
    previous in-worker `time.Sleep` only paused the worker that failed; with
    `--max-workers > 1`, other workers would claim the retry immediately and
    inherit the same broken state. Failover clears the column so a fresh agent
    is not held by the prior gate. Default backoff is 2s.
- The CI batch poller no longer unclaims batches that were finalized by a racing
    event path. Stale-claim recovery now checks the batch's terminal state
    before reverting it. Permanent GitHub access errors on moved or deleted
    repositories finalize the batch instead of retrying forever.
- `roborev init` works in worktrees backed by `git clone --bare`. The git helper
    now detects linked worktrees whose common git directory is bare and resolves
    them to the checkout root, so Middleman-style bare-backed worktrees can be
    registered. Behavior for normal linked worktrees and submodule worktrees is
    unchanged.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.55

<small>2026-05-15</small>

**New features**

- `security` analyze type runs `roborev analyze security <files>` with a
    security-focused prompt covering authn/authz, trust boundaries, injection,
    file/secret handling, cryptography, and dependency risks. Jobs are tagged
    `review_type = security` so `security_agent` and `security_model` config
    (and the per-reasoning-level variants) apply automatically. See
    [Code Analysis](/commands/#code-analysis).
- `roborev status --json` emits structured daemon and queue status, including
    the active daemon endpoint as `network`, `address`, and `port` fields so
    scripts and integrations can discover the listening transport without
    reading runtime files.

**Improvements**

- Review templates for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini drop the "diff and static
    analysis only" framing and explicitly permit reading other repo files to
    verify claims. Agents are still prohibited from building, running tests, or
    executing code; the change reduces false-negative findings (e.g. "this
    package doesn't exist") on PRs that reference code outside the diff.
    Non-templated agents (Copilot, OpenCode, Cursor, Kiro, Kilo, Droid, Pi) use
    the fallback prompt and are unchanged.
- The TUI queue hides auto-design-router classifier jobs (`job_type = classify`)
    and skipped design rows (`status = skipped`, scoped to
    `source = auto_design`) by default to reduce per-commit routing noise. A new
    `show_classify_jobs` global config (with nullable per-repo override) and an
    `s` TUI hotkey toggle visibility; the queue footer and `?` help screen
    reflect the current state. Pressing `l` on a hidden classifier or skipped
    row shows the classifier verdict and `skip_reason` above the streamed log.
    The daemon status endpoint's skipped/triggered counters are unchanged. See
    [Auto Design Review](/configuration/#auto-design-review).
- Codex review jobs default to `skills.include_instructions=false` and
    `--ignore-user-config`, so review prompts run without skill instructions or
    user-level Codex config. Two global toggles under `[agent.codex]` control
    this (`disable_review_skills`, `ignore_review_user_config`); both default to
    `true`. Fix jobs are not affected. See
    [Codex Review Options](/configuration/#codex-review-options).

**Bug fixes**

- Gemini-based reviews can now read external diff snapshots. The Gemini agent
    receives the per-snapshot temp directory in its allowed-paths list (matching
    the Codex `--add-dir` behavior introduced in 0.54), restoring access to the
    expected context for large diffs.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    disabling Codex review skill context by default, adding security analyze
    mode, and exposing the daemon endpoint in JSON status output.
- Thanks to [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) for allowing review
    agents to read repo files when verifying diffs, exposing Gemini diff
    snapshot directories, and hiding auto-design-router noise from the queue by
    default.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.54

<small>2026-05-07</small>

**New features**

- `--batch-size N` flag on `roborev fix` to pack up to N reviews into a single
    agent invocation, still bounded by the configured `max_prompt_size`. This
    sits between the default one-fix-per-prompt mode and `--batch` (everything
    in one prompt): you get coordinated multi-finding fixes per call without
    exceeding the prompt budget. Mutually exclusive with `--batch` and `--list`.
    See [Fixing Reviews](/commands/#fixing-reviews).
- `--resume` flag on `roborev fix` to reuse the agent's session ID across calls
    within a single fix run, so chained fixes build on prior context instead of
    starting fresh each call. Defaults to off.

**Improvements**

- Large diff prompts are kept in external snapshot files instead of being
    expanded back into agent prompts. roborev now applies an agent-agnostic
    final prompt-size gate before submission and treats context-window failures
    as non-retryable failover candidates rather than retrying the same oversized
    prompt. Snapshots are written to per-snapshot temp directories that are
    readable by all agents.
- Review prompts now instruct agents to separate multiple findings with `---` on
    its own line so findings render as distinct entries instead of running
    together. Applies across the default, dirty, range, and security templates
    as well as the Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini variants.
- The README header logo uses a dark-background variant on GitHub dark mode (via
    a `<picture>` element with `prefers-color-scheme`), so the dark-text logo no
    longer becomes unreadable on dark backgrounds.

**Bug fixes**

- The foreground `roborev fix` loop now classifies agent errors and aborts
    cleanly when it detects a quota or session limit, instead of demoting these
    failures to per-job warnings during discovery mode. A new `internal/agent`
    rate-limit classifier (`LimitKind`, `LimitClassification`,
    `ParseResetDuration`, `ParseResetTime`) is shared between the daemon worker
    and the CLI fix loop, so cooldown behavior is consistent across both paths
    and unmatched agent errors are logged with a truncated preview instead of
    being silent.
- Codex large-diff snapshots are written to per-snapshot subdirectories, and
    Codex receives the snapshot directory via `--add-dir` instead of full `/tmp`
    access. This restores Codex's ability to read external diff snapshots while
    avoiding exposure of unrelated `/tmp` contents. Snapshot-shaped paths in
    prompts are ignored unless they resolve to existing files inside a private
    roborev snapshot directory.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for exposing
    Codex diff snapshot directories and keeping large diff prompts external.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.53.1

<small>2026-05-04</small>

**Improvements**

- ACP session validation: the first ACP session update is validated against the
    agent's configured session ID before being stored. Mismatches are logged but
    no longer return errors, avoiding connection breaks during normal operation.
- ACP model resolution: `ModelForSelectedAgent` falls back to the model
    configured in the `[acp]` section when no workflow-specific model is set,
    giving consistent model selection across review, analyze, fix, refine, and
    daemon paths.
- Clearer error messages for invalid ACP configuration and model settings, with
    improved permission handling during session setup.

**Bug fixes**

- `review --branch`, `analyze --branch`, and `refine` correctly auto-detect the
    branch base when the upstream is configured as a raw URL (e.g.
    `https://example.com/fork.git`) rather than a registered remote name.
    URL-shaped values previously produced invalid refs like
    `refs/remotes/https://.../main` that failed to resolve, breaking branch-base
    detection for affected repos. roborev now detects URL-shaped remote values
    via prefix and `://` checks, after first confirming the value is not a
    registered remote name, and falls through to the next detection step.
- Per-branch `branch.<name>.base` overrides are now consulted by review, refine,
    and analyze flows. The override was already documented as a per-branch base
    override but was being skipped in favor of upstream-tracking detection.

<small>2026-04-30</small>

**New features**

- Opt-in automatic design-review router. roborev can now decide per commit
    whether to dispatch a `--type design` review, using cheap heuristics first
    (path globs, diff size, file count, commit-subject regexes) and a
    schema-constrained classifier as a fallback for ambiguous cases. Off by
    default; turn it on globally with `[auto_design_review] enabled = true` in
    `~/.roborev/config.toml` or per repo in `.roborev.toml`. The post-commit,
    `roborev review`, range, and dirty paths and the CI poller all consult the
    router; design jobs are emitted only when the router says yes, otherwise a
    skipped row is recorded with the deciding reason and rendered dimmed in the
    TUI. Classifier behavior is tunable via `classify_agent`, `classify_model`,
    `classify_reasoning`, `classify_backup_agent`, and `classify_backup_model`.
    The classifier requires a `SchemaAgent`-capable backend (Claude Code,
    Codex); other agents are rejected at config-resolve time. See
    [Auto Design Review](/configuration/#auto-design-review).

**Improvements**

- Daemon HTTP API consolidated under [Huma](https://huma.rocks/). Routes,
    request and response types, and handlers move to a single Huma-backed
    registration in `internal/daemon/routes.go`, and the OpenAPI spec served at
    `/openapi.json` is now available in both 3.1 (default) and 3.0 (downgraded)
    flavors. The TUI talks to the daemon through a generated OpenAPI client
    (`internal/daemon_client`) for normal JSON calls; streaming endpoints
    continue to use plain handlers. This is internal plumbing; existing CLI and
    TUI behavior is unchanged.
- The CI poller runs the auto design-review router on the PR head SHA when
    `design` is not already in the configured review matrix. Heuristic-input
    failures (missing diff, changed-files, or commit message) degrade to the
    classifier instead of being silently skipped, so misconfigured repos surface
    a real outcome.
- Shell completion for `roborev review --type` suggests `security` and `design`,
    matching the existing pattern for `--agent` and `--reasoning`. Tab-complete
    the value directly without typing it out.
- New `roborev repo move <name-or-path> <new-path>` subcommand updates a tracked
    repository's stored root path after a directory rename or move on disk, so
    existing jobs and reviews stay attached to the same repo entry. See
    [Repository Management](/guides/repository-management/#moving-or-renaming-a-repository).

**Bug fixes**

- `roborev fix` now discovers reviews when run from a detached HEAD. Open-job
    filtering walks the commit chain back to the first reachable branch tip and
    matches jobs against the detached commits and review ranges that end on
    them. `dirty` jobs and unrelated refs remain excluded.
- The TUI's `auto_filter_repo` startup filter now reconciles renamed and moved
    repos through their stored display name and identity, so renamed
    repositories still surface their existing reviews instead of appearing
    empty.
- `review --branch`, `analyze --branch`, `refine`, and the post-commit
    branch-review path now resolve the merge-base against the current branch's
    `@{upstream}` (e.g. `upstream/main` in fork workflows), falling back to the
    configured default branch only when no upstream is set. The previous
    behavior pulled in commits already merged upstream when the local
    `origin/main` was behind. The `currentBranch == LocalBranchName(base)`
    guardrail is replaced by `git.IsOnBaseBranch`, which generalizes the
    `origin/` shortcut, handles non-origin remotes, and stops misclassifying
    local branches whose names contain slashes (e.g. `feature/foo`).
- Tab-completing `roborev review --type <TAB>` no longer falls through to
    filename completion when no value has been typed yet. The completion now
    returns just `security` and `design` and disables filename fallback.
- Claude Code's durable scheduled-task files (`.claude/scheduled_tasks.json`,
    `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`) are added to `.gitignore` so the harness's
    local cron state does not get accidentally tracked.

    detached-HEAD review discovery, migrating the daemon API to Huma, and

<small>2026-04-19</small>

**New features**

- Route Claude Code through an OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible proxy (Ollama,
    LiteLLM, LM Studio, etc.) via a `<model>@<base_url>` model spec. When a
    proxy URL is present, roborev pins all Claude Code tier aliases
    (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku/subagent) to the specified model and points the agent at
    the given endpoint, making it possible to use local models for reviews and
    fixes. See
    [Routing Claude Code to a proxy](/agents/#routing-claude-code-to-a-proxy).

**Improvements**

- Review prompts are more consistent across agents, with reduced low-value noise
    in review output.
- Streamed tool-call names and input fields are normalized across agents for
    cleaner agent output in the TUI and daemon logs.
- OpenCode output shows tool calls and drops migration noise from `stderr`.

**Bug fixes**

- TUI clipboard copy works over SSH by falling back to OSC52 escape sequences
    when a local clipboard is unavailable.
- `j`, `k`, and `q` can be typed normally while editing TUI filter searches,
    instead of being captured as navigation/quit shortcuts.
- Gemini severity threshold parsing no longer fails when marker strings include
    internal whitespace.

!!! warning

    Breaking change: when the `claude-code` agent runs, roborev now strips inherited
    `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`,
    `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`
    from the child environment. If you were routing Claude Code by exporting these
    variables in your shell, switch to the `<model>@<base_url>` spec or configure
    `anthropic_api_key` in `~/.roborev/config.toml`.

## 0.51

<small>2026-04-08</small>

**New features**

- OpenAPI spec for the daemon REST API, served at `/openapi.json` (OpenAPI 3.1.0
    via Huma). The spec covers the primary query and mutation endpoints used by
    integrations (jobs, reviews, comments, repos, branches, status, summary,
    cancel, rerun, close). Internal endpoints used by the CLI, TUI, and daemon
    subsystems (enqueue, streaming, sync, fix orchestration) are not part of the
    OpenAPI surface. See
    [Streaming & Daemon API](/advanced/streaming/#daemon-api).
- Cascading `review_min_severity` setting and `--min-severity` flag on
    `roborev review` to filter review findings by severity. The setting cascades
    from CLI flag to per-repo `.roborev.toml` to global `config.toml`, matching
    the existing pattern for `fix_min_severity` and `refine_min_severity`.
    Global defaults for all three (`review_min_severity`, `fix_min_severity`,
    `refine_min_severity`) are now supported in global config. See
    [Configuration](/configuration/#per-repository-options).

**Improvements**

- Branch review prompts include per-commit review context. When reviewing a
    commit range, the prompt includes summaries and verdicts from individual
    per-commit reviews, with instructions to focus on cross-commit interactions
    instead of re-raising known issues.
- Fix prompts include user comments and prior tool attempts. Developer comments
    and previous automated fix attempts are separated and included in the
    prompt, giving the fix agent more context about what has already been tried
    and what the developer flagged.
- Global reasoning defaults are honored consistently across review, fix, refine,
    and related workflows. Resolution order: explicit CLI flag > per-repo config
    \> global config > default.
- The TUI lets you inspect the full prompt while a job is still queued, before
    it starts running. Press `p` on any queued job that has a stored prompt
    (task, fix, compact, insights).

**Bug fixes**

- `roborev fix` correctly discovers open jobs on the current branch. Previously,
    it could include jobs from unrelated branches or miss jobs when run from
    `main` due to unreachable SHAs from squashed or amended commits.
- Codex sandbox compatibility improvements. A new `disable_codex_sandbox` config
    option bypasses `bwrap` sandboxing on systems where it is unavailable.
    Read-only sandboxed reviews fall back to inline diff snapshots when `.git/`
    is inaccessible to the agent. See
    [Configuration](/configuration/#global-options).
- Codex review jobs now store and display the actual command line used, fixing
    incorrect command reporting in the TUI.
- CI repo matching resolves ambiguous repositories (multiple repos sharing the
    same git identity) by preferring auto-cloned repos instead of failing.
- GitHub Actions release checksums use the expected `SHA256SUMS` filename.

    cascading, review-level filtering, config/worktree/CI reasoning fixes, and

## 0.50

<small>2026-03-31</small>

**New features**

- `auto_close_passing_reviews` config option to automatically close reviews that
    pass with no findings. When enabled, pass reviews are closed immediately
    instead of staying open in the queue. See
    [Configuration](/configuration/#auto-close-passing-reviews).
- Bundled `roborev-refine` skills for Claude Code and Codex to run iterative
    review-fix-review loops from within an agent session. The skill performs the
    full refine workflow inline (review, fix, commit, re-review) rather than
    shelling out to the CLI. See
    [Agent Skills](/guides/agent-skills/#refine-a-branch).
- Bundled systemd service and socket unit files for Linux daemon deployments.
    The service uses `Type=notify` for readiness signaling. Socket activation is
    supported for on-demand daemon startup. See
    [Persistent Daemon](/configuration/#persistent-daemon).

**Improvements**

- The TUI updates instantly by subscribing to the daemon event stream (SSE)
    instead of polling on a timer. Polling is retained as a 15-second fallback.
- CI review prompts now include human PR discussion (issue comments, review
    summaries, and inline review comments) from trusted collaborators with
    maintain or admin access. Discussion is treated as untrusted context with
    safety guardrails.
- The daemon socket path prefers `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/roborev/daemon.sock` when the
    variable is set and points to an existing absolute directory. Falls back to
    the platform temp directory otherwise. See
    [Configuration](/configuration/#unix-domain-socket).

**Bug fixes**

- Preserve the requested model when rerunning reviews. Previously, rerunning a
    review could resolve a different model from config defaults instead of
    preserving the model specified in the original request. A separate
    `requested_model` field now tracks explicit user intent.
- Enforce a `batch_timeout` (default: 3 minutes) on CI PR comment batches to
    prevent indefinite hangs when some jobs in a multi-agent batch get stuck.
    When the timeout expires, available results are posted and remaining jobs
    are canceled. See
    [CI Options Reference](/integrations/github/#ci-options-reference).

    unit files, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` daemon socket handling, and systemd socket

## 0.49

<small>2026-03-24</small>

**New features**

- `roborev insights` command analyzes failing code reviews to identify recurring
    patterns, hotspot areas, noise candidates, and guideline gaps. Outputs
    actionable suggestions for improving `review_guidelines` in `.roborev.toml`.
    Runs as a daemon-backed job, queued and tracked like reviews. See
    [Commands](/commands/#insights).
- Unix domain socket support for CLI-to-daemon communication on Unix systems.
    Set `server_addr = "unix://"` in `~/.roborev/config.toml` to listen on
    `/tmp/roborev-{UID}/daemon.sock` instead of TCP loopback. Socket permissions
    (`0600`) enforce per-user access control. See
    [Configuration](/configuration/#unix-domain-socket).
- `ROBOREV_COLOR_MODE` environment variable to force `auto`, `dark`, `light`, or
    `none` color output across all TUI screens and CLI rendering. See
    [Configuration](/configuration/#color-mode).

**Improvements**

- Skill installation and status reporting use a shared multi-agent catalog.
    `roborev skills` now shows per-agent status (installed, outdated, not
    installed, no agent) for both Claude Code and Codex. Adding future agents
    requires a single catalog entry.
- Large Codex reviews are more reliable. Prompt budgeting is now configurable
    via `max_prompt_size` (per repo) and `default_max_prompt_size` (global),
    with smart fallback instructions that guide Codex to read diffs locally when
    they exceed the prompt budget. Diffs are read in bounded chunks with
    UTF-8-safe truncation.
- Pre-commit auto-fixes and lint hook management now use
    [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) instead of a custom shell script (roborev
    development workflow only).

**Bug fixes**

- `NO_COLOR` is honored on TUI review and prompt detail screens. Previously,
    glamour markdown rendering defaulted to TrueColor regardless of `NO_COLOR`.
- `roborev refine` branch reviews now use the configured review agent instead of
    the fix agent.
- Reviews and hooks for commits made in git worktrees now run in the correct
    worktree directory. A `worktree_path` field is persisted per job so agents
    and hooks operate on the right branch.
- Copilot reviews no longer fail with permission denials in non-interactive
    (daemon) mode. The agent now uses `--allow-all-tools` with a deny-list for
    destructive operations in review mode.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.48

<small>2026-03-18</small>

**Improvements**

- Review agents now run in a read-only sandbox. Codex review jobs use
    `--sandbox read-only` instead of `--full-auto`, matching Claude Code's
    existing read-only tool restrictions. Agentic mode (fix, refine,
    `--agentic`) is unchanged. All agent subprocesses set `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`
    to avoid contending with the user's own git operations.
- `--open` and `--unaddressed` flags on `roborev fix` are deprecated. Open job
    discovery is now the default behavior when no positional job IDs are
    provided. The flags are hidden and silently ignored for backwards
    compatibility.
- `--branch <name>` flag added to `roborev fix` for cross-branch fixing without
    switching branches.
- Skip update notifications in development builds.

**Bug fixes**

- Avoid `.git/index.lock` contention during reviews by setting
    `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0` in agent subprocess environments, reducing conflicts
    with concurrent git operations.
- Fix `--all-branches` and `--branch` filtering when running `roborev fix` from
    a git worktree. The branch override was not being threaded through to
    `filterReachableJobs`, causing it to filter by the worktree's branch instead
    of the requested branch.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    refactoring worktree helper flows.
- Thanks to [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) for skipping update
    notifications on dev builds and speeding up the test suite.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.47

<small>2026-03-17</small>

**New features**

- `roborev summary` command shows aggregate review statistics: pass/fail trends,
    per-agent effectiveness, review duration percentiles, fix resolution rates,
    and per-repo breakdowns. Scopes to the current repo by default; use `--all`
    for cross-repo summary. Supports `--since`, `--branch`, `--repo`, and
    `--json` flags. See [Commands](/commands/#review-statistics).
- TUI control socket for programmatic interaction with running TUI instances.
    External tools can query state and trigger mutations (filter, select, close,
    cancel, rerun, quit) over a Unix domain socket using a newline-delimited
    JSON protocol. Runtime metadata is written to `~/.roborev/tui.{PID}.json`
    for discoverability. See
    [TUI Control Socket](/integrations/tui/#control-socket).
- `--no-quit` flag on `roborev tui` suppresses keyboard quit (`q`) in queue and
    tasks views, allowing external controllers to manage the TUI lifecycle. The
    `quit` control command still works regardless.
- Token usage tracking: agent token consumption (peak context tokens and total
    output tokens) is automatically recorded after each job completes and
    displayed in the TUI review header and `roborev show` output. Requires
    `agentsview` to be installed. `roborev backfill-tokens` retroactively
    fetches token data for completed jobs that have session IDs but no stored
    usage.
- `opencode_cmd` config key to override the OpenCode executable path, matching
    the existing pattern for other `*_cmd` overrides.

**Improvements**

- Common lockfiles and generated files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, go.sum,
    Cargo.lock, uv.lock, and others) are excluded from review diffs by default.
    Add custom patterns via `exclude_patterns` in global or per-repo config.
    Security reviews skip repo-level exclude patterns to prevent suppression of
    sensitive files. See [Configuration](/configuration/#exclude-patterns).
- `maximum` reasoning level (aliases: `max`, `xhigh`) maps to Codex's xhigh
    reasoning effort. For agents without an xhigh equivalent, it maps to
    thorough. See [Reasoning Levels](/configuration/#reasoning-levels).
- Session ID column in the TUI queue view.
- Column checkboxes in the TUI options menu respond to mouse clicks.
- Long comment text word-wraps in the TUI review pane.
- The TUI elapsed timer updates every second instead of only on data refreshes.
- Skill names switched from colon syntax (`roborev:fix`) to hyphenated syntax
    (`roborev-fix`) for compatibility with GitHub Copilot CLI. Run
    `roborev skills update` to apply the new names. Both Claude Code and Codex
    skills are updated.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix `GetCurrentBranch` returning a `heads/`-prefixed branch name when git refs
    are ambiguous.
- Update Gemini defaults and fall back cleanly when the configured model is
    unavailable.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) for isolating tests from
    global git config, fixing a session-stream test agent leak, adding the TUI
    elapsed-time tick, and ignoring `.claude/worktrees`.

    column-option improvements, and Copilot-compatible skill names.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.46

<small>2026-03-11</small>

**Improvements**

- Agent availability checks now honor `*_cmd` config overrides
    (`claude_code_cmd`, `codex_cmd`, `cursor_cmd`, `pi_cmd`). Previously, custom
    agent commands were ignored during availability detection, so an agent could
    appear unavailable even when the configured binary was in PATH. See
    [Agent Command Overrides](/configuration/#agent-command-overrides).
- The TUI review screen now displays the branch name stored with the review
    instead of resolving it dynamically via `git name-rev`. In worktree setups
    where the same SHA is reachable from multiple refs, the old behavior could
    display the wrong branch.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix the post-commit hook sending the worktree path instead of the main
    repository root to the daemon when running inside a linked git worktree.
    This caused commits to be registered under a phantom repo entry.
- Fix `roborev fix --open`, `--list`, and `--batch` discovering reviews from
    other worktrees. Jobs are now filtered to only those reachable from the
    current worktree's HEAD or matching its branch name.
- Fix the post-commit hook not firing in linked git worktrees when
    `core.hooksPath` is set to a relative path. Relative paths are now resolved
    against the main repository root instead of the worktree root. `init`,
    `install-hook`, and `uninstall-hook` also normalize the hooks path and fail
    early if it cannot be resolved.
- Add JSONL post-commit hook logging to `~/.roborev/post-commit.log` so that
    silent hook failures leave an audit trail with timestamps, repo paths, and
    failure reasons. See
    [Troubleshooting](/guides/troubleshooting/#post-commit-hook-log).

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for fixing
    post-commit hooks in git worktrees and migrating tests to testify.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.45

<small>2026-03-08</small>

**New features**

- `--min-severity` flag for `roborev fix` and `roborev refine` to limit fixes to
    findings at or above a chosen severity (`low`, `medium`, `high`,
    `critical`). Also configurable per repo via `fix_min_severity` and
    `refine_min_severity` in `.roborev.toml`. When all findings in a review fall
    below the threshold, `refine` automatically closes the review instead of
    treating it as a fix failure.
- Experimental: `reuse_review_session` config option (global and per repo) to
    resume prior agent sessions on the same branch, reducing token usage and
    review latency on active branches. See
    [Session Reuse](/guides/reviewing-code/#session-reuse).

**Improvements**

- `roborev show` now displays comments after the review output, matching the TUI
    review detail view.
- Copied reviews (TUI `y` key) now include review comments, giving the fix agent
    more context when you paste into an agent session.
- Agent tool-call narration (text the agent emits before tool calls) is stripped
    from persisted review output across all agents.
- Daemon status details are hidden from the review detail view in the TUI; the
    queue view is unchanged.
- Review prompts now instruct agents not to build projects, run tests, or
    execute code during review.
- `roborev config set` and `roborev init` now produce commented TOML output with
    inline descriptions for each field.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix `roborev compact` using the wrong branch inside git worktrees. It was
    resolving the main checkout's branch instead of the worktree's branch.
- Fix workflow model fallback so it uses the selected agent's actual default
    model instead of the global default.
- Job log files are no longer permanently lost when the initial file open fails
    under resource pressure. The new log writer retries and buffers output until
    disk logging recovers.
- Timed-out review jobs now unwind reliably instead of appearing to run past the
    configured `job_timeout`. Timeout errors are recorded as
    `agent timeout after <duration>` for clearer reporting in the TUI and hooks.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    documenting auto-written TOML config files and safely reusing review
    sessions on the current branch.

## 0.44

<small>2026-03-07</small>

**New features**

- `mouse_enabled` global config flag (and TUI options menu toggle) to disable
    mouse interactions in the TUI.
- `roborev post-commit` command and `post_commit_review` repo config to control
    post-commit review behavior, including branch review workflows.
- Webhook review hooks (`type = "webhook"`) for external integrations.
- `excluded_commit_patterns` repo config for skipping reviews based on commit
    message substrings.
- `auto_filter_branch` global config to automatically filter the TUI to the
    current branch or worktree on startup.

**Improvements**

- Tighter review prompts and more consistent verdict parsing.
- Daemon/client mismatch warnings surfaced through daemon status output.

**Bug fixes**

- Retry `fix` daemon calls automatically after a daemon restart.
- Fix daemon startup restart loops.
- Fix Enter key handling in the TUI inside embedded terminals.
- Fix cases where the TUI fails to close cleanly.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for the
    mouse-disable config flag, webhook review hook support, and job session ID
    capture.

## 0.43

<small>2026-03-06</small>

**New features**

- `default_backup_model` config option to control the fallback model used by
    agent workflows when the primary model is unavailable.
- `advanced.tasks_enabled` config flag to opt in to the TUI background tasks
    workflow (fix jobs, patch application, and rebasing). This workflow was
    previously enabled by default and has been moved behind a flag to avoid
    confusion about the primary review workflow.

**Improvements**

- `Ctrl-D` quits the TUI as an additional shortcut alongside `q`.
- Improved built-in agent skill definitions for more reliable matching, and
    expanded agent configuration documentation.

**Bug fixes**

- Agent resolution for `review`, `analyze`, `fix`, and `refine` commands now
    selects the intended agent more reliably.
- CLI `--agent` overrides no longer inherit the wrong `default_model` from
    configuration.

    TUI quit handling and gating the advanced TUI tasks workflow behind

## 0.42

<small>2026-03-05</small>

**New features**

- Multi-repo workspace support: `roborev list` looks in immediate child
    subfolders for repos, and `roborev review` suggests repo-level review
    commands.
- Cursor agent support.
- Pi coding agent support.
- Save generated patch files to disk from the TUI Tasks view.

**Improvements**

- Skip review throttling when a new push supersedes an in-progress review. The
    old review is canceled and the new one starts immediately.
- Validate configured agent names and reject unknown agents earlier.

**Bug fixes**

- Improve Claude review failure reporting so agent errors are captured and
    surfaced correctly.

**Acknowledgements**

## 0.41

<small>2026-03-04</small>

**Bug fixes**

- Restore a separate `P/F` verdict column in the TUI queue so review outcomes
    are easier to scan.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.40

<small>2026-03-03</small>

**New features**

- ACP (Agent Client Protocol) support: run reviews through any ACP-compatible
    agent via the `[acp]` config section.
- Kiro agent integration via `kiro-cli`.
- Configurable PR comment upsert: update existing roborev PR comments instead of
    posting duplicates (`ci.upsert_comments`).

**Improvements**

- Renamed review status terminology to `closed`/`open` across CLI, TUI, and API.
    `roborev close` and `roborev fix --open` replace the legacy command/flag
    aliases (which are still accepted).
- Combined the separate Status and P/F columns in the TUI queue into a single
    Status column with color-coded states (Queued, Running, Pass, Fail, Error,
    Canceled).
- Column customization in the TUI: press `o` to reorder or toggle column
    visibility. New `column_borders`, `column_order`, and `task_column_order`
    config options.
- Mouse copy/paste in TUI content views; long stderr lines wrap in log views.
- Visual polish across TUI queue, review, and task screens: tighter column
    spacing, box-drawing separators, right-aligned elapsed column.
- Deprecated the `/roborev:address` skill in favor of `/roborev:fix`.

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed UTF-8 truncation when composing PR comments.
- Fixed command/footer parsing by trimming trailing blank lines and enforcing
    `--` separators.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Danny Steenman](https://github.com/dannysteenman) for configurable
    PR comment upserts and UTF-8 truncation fixes.

## 0.38

<small>2026-02-26</small>

**New features**

- Kilo agent support via the `kilo` CLI.
- `roborev wait` accepts multiple job IDs in a single command.

**Improvements**

- TUI task view supports mouse interactions (click to select, double-click to
    view).
- `roborev update` manages the daemon lifecycle for smoother upgrades.

**Bug fixes**

- Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the OpenCode agent in GitHub Actions workflows.
- `roborev fix` skips reviews that already have a `PASS` verdict.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for multiple
    job IDs in `roborev wait`, mouse improvements for TUI tasks, and Kilo agent
    support.

## 0.37

<small>2026-02-25</small>

**Improvements**

- TUI help bar restyled with two-tone key hints and aligned columns for easier
    shortcut scanning.
- Unified stream output formatting across CLI and TUI views for more consistent
    display.

**Bug fixes**

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Miki Tebeka](https://github.com/tebeka) for reporting the correct
    version when roborev is installed with `go install`.
- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for
    restyling the TUI help bar with aligned two-tone keys.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.36

<small>2026-02-24</small>

**New features**

- `roborev tui --repo` and `--branch` flags to launch the TUI pre-filtered to a
    specific repository or branch. Without a value, each flag resolves to the
    current repo/branch. With `=` syntax (e.g. `--repo=/path/to/repo`,
    `--branch=feature-x`), the value is used directly. When set via flags, the
    filter is locked and cannot be changed in the TUI.
- Inline fix panel in the TUI review view: press `F` while viewing a review to
    open a fix prompt at the bottom of the screen instead of a full-screen
    modal. `Tab` toggles focus between the review content and the fix input.
    `Enter` submits, `Esc` cancels.
- Shell completions for `--agent` and `--reasoning` flags across all commands
    that accept them (`init`, `review`, `run`, `fix`, `analyze`, `refine`).
- OpenCode JSON stream support: the OpenCode agent now uses `--format json` for
    structured JSONL output, integrated into the unified stream formatter for
    consistent progress rendering.
- CI repository matching with wildcard patterns and exclusion lists. `ci.repos`
    entries now support glob patterns (e.g. `"myorg/*"`, `"myorg/api-*"`) using
    `path.Match` syntax. New `exclude_repos` field filters out matching repos,
    and `max_repos` (default: 100) caps the total expanded count. Wildcard
    results are cached for one hour.

**Improvements**

- TUI help bar uses table-based rendering for consistent column alignment across
    all views.

**Bug fixes**

- `--all-branches` now implies `--open` on `roborev fix` and `roborev refine`,
    removing the need to pass both flags.
- Patch application in git worktrees resolves the correct worktree path via
    `git worktree list`, fixing failures when the branch is checked out in a
    non-default worktree location.
- Temporary command execution uses explicit file sync and retry with exponential
    backoff to prevent intermittent `text file busy` (ETXTBSY) races on Linux.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for TUI
    repo/branch flags, help bar alignment, temp-command race fixes, shell
    completions, worktree patch-path handling, and the inline fix panel.

    wildcard patterns and exclusion lists.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.35

<small>2026-02-23</small>

**New features**

- Shell completion for `roborev analyze` command types: tab-complete analysis
    type names (e.g. `roborev analyze <TAB>` suggests `refactor`, `complexity`,
    etc.).
- Persistent job logs: agent output is written to `~/.roborev/logs/jobs/` as
    NDJSON so review activity survives daemon restarts.
- Unified log viewer: `roborev log <job-id>` renders stored job output on the
    CLI, and pressing `l` in the TUI opens a scrollable log viewer with live
    polling for running jobs. `roborev log clean` removes old log files.

**Improvements**

- Test and production runtime data are isolated so `go test` runs do not pollute
    `~/.roborev/` logs or interfere with the production daemon.
- CLI and TUI streaming output uses gutter-grouped tool calls, markdown text
    wrapping, and Codex reasoning item rendering for clearer review progress.

**Bug fixes**

- Handle empty Git refs when fixing compact review jobs to prevent fix-flow
    failures. The server resolves a usable ref from the parent job's branch or
    falls back to HEAD, and the TUI shows a confirmation modal when no ref is
    available.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Marius van Niekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk) for analyze
    command shell completions and compact-review fix handling for empty git
    refs.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0.34

<small>2026-02-22</small>

**New features**

- `roborev ci review`: daemon-free batch reviews for CI pipelines with
    auto-detection of GitHub Actions environment variables (`GITHUB_REPOSITORY`,
    `GITHUB_REF`, `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`).
- `roborev init gh-action`: generates a GitHub Actions workflow file with
    SHA256-verified roborev installation and agent setup.
- TUI fix jobs: press `F` on a completed review to launch a background fix in an
    isolated worktree. New Tasks view (`T`) for managing fix jobs and applying
    patches.
- CI poller auto-clone: repos in `ci.repos` no longer require a local
    `roborev init` checkout. The poller clones them automatically to
    `~/.roborev/clones/`.
- Quota-aware agent cooldown: agents that hit hard quota limits enter a timed
    cooldown (default 30 min) with automatic failover to backup agents. CI
    comments show "skipped (quota)" instead of "failed".
- Daemon activity logging for better operational visibility.

**Improvements**

- Review verdicts are stored for reuse in later review workflows.

**Bug fixes**

- Fix jobs now create worktrees at the reviewed commit instead of HEAD,
    preventing patches against the wrong revision.
- Database migration no longer crashes on databases with quoted table names from
    prior ALTER TABLE migrations.
- Missing git origin remote treated as confirmed mismatch for auto-clone instead
    of a transient error.
- Fixed a data race between `WorkerPool.Start` and `WorkerPool.Stop`.

**Acknowledgements**

- Thanks to [Hugh Brown](https://github.com/hughdbrown) for storing verdicts for
    later use.

## 0.33

<small>2026-02-17</small>

**New features**

- `roborev compact` command to verify and consolidate open review findings,
    reducing false positives and merging related findings from multiple reviews
    into a single consolidated review.
- Backup-agent failover: automatically retry failed jobs with a secondary agent
    when the primary fails (e.g. fall back to Claude Code when Codex
    rate-limits).
- GitHub commit status checks: the CI poller posts pending/success/failure
    statuses on PR commits when GitHub App auth is configured.
- Ref-aware configuration: the CI poller reads `.roborev.toml` from the PR
    branch's git ref, so configuration can vary by branch.
- `--label` flag on `roborev run` for custom labels displayed in the TUI.

**Improvements**

- Consolidated review guidelines for more consistent review output across
    commands.
- Hardened CI and hook workflows for more reliable automated runs.

**Bug fixes**

- Post-rewrite hook preserves review history across rebases by remapping commit
    SHAs when patch content is unchanged.
- Skip hook upgrade checks in CI mode to avoid CI interruptions.
