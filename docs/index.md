# roborev

Continuous code review for coding agents. Review commits immediately, catch
issues early, and fix them while context is fresh.

## How roborev works

![How roborev works](/assets/static/how-it-works.svg){ loading=eager }

roborev reviews every commit in the background and feeds findings back to your
coding agent so the write -> review -> fix loop runs hands-off.

- **Post-commit reviews** - every commit is reviewed automatically, with any
    agent.
- **Agent hook** - nudges your CLI agent to fix findings mid-session.
- **Refine before you ship** - `/roborev-refine` re-reviews and fixes your whole
    branch until every review passes, catching bugs before the PR.

## Browser UI

Run `roborev ui` to open the native browser application. Browse and filter the
live review queue, inspect review output, prompts, and logs, manage jobs and
comments, or switch to Analytics to explore cost, latency, reliability, and
review outcomes. The application runs from the local daemon and uses the same
SQLite history as the CLI and terminal UI.

## Terminal UI

Prefer to stay in the terminal? `roborev tui` provides the same live review
ledger with vim-style navigation. On a large terminal, its split-screen layout
keeps the queue and selected review visible together.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://roborev.io/install.sh | bash
```

Then from within your git repositories:

```bash
roborev init          # Install post-commit hook
# do some work, generate commits
roborev tui           # Browse reviews in the terminal UI
roborev ui            # Or browse reviews in the native browser UI
```

For Windows, see the
[installation guide](/installation/#quick-install-recommended).

## For LLMs

This docs site publishes source Markdown next to each rendered page. Prefer the
`.md` URL when reading or citing docs programmatically: `/changelog.md` for
`/changelog/`, `/guides/reviewing-code.md` for `/guides/reviewing-code/`, and
`/index.md` for this page.

## Why roborev?

AI coding agents write code fast, but they make mistakes. Most review feedback
comes too late. The agent has moved on and context is lost. roborev changes
this:

1. **Ask your agents to commit often**, ideally every turn of work
1. **roborev reviews** each commit in the background
1. **Bring review work back into the agent session** with
    [`agent-hook`](/agent-hook/) (`--agent droid` for Factory Droid) or check
    the TUI (`roborev tui`) as findings arrive
1. **Address findings** by letting the hook prompt the fix skill, copying
    reviews into your agent, using [`/roborev-fix`](/guides/agent-skills/), or
    running `roborev fix`

Every commit gets reviewed. Issues surface in seconds, not hours. Open reviews
stay in the TUI queue until explicitly addressed and closed, so nothing falls
through the cracks.

- **Review Ledger**

    Every commit is reviewed automatically via git hooks. Reviews accumulate in a
    persistent queue that acts as a ledger: nothing is closed until explicitly
    addressed.

- **Agent-Ready Feedback**

    Use `agent-hook` to prompt Codex, Claude Code, or Droid (`--agent droid`) to
    run the fix skill when review work piles up. You can also copy findings into
    your agent session, use `/roborev-fix`, or run `roborev fix` to apply fixes
    automatically.

- **Code Analysis**

    Built-in analysis types (duplication, complexity, refactoring, test fixtures,
    dead code) that agents can address directly.

- **Multi-Agent**

    Works with Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, Cursor, Droid, Kilo,
    Kiro, Pi, and Grok Build. Auto-detects installed agents.

- **Rich Markdown Display**

    Reviews render with full Markdown formatting: syntax-highlighted code blocks,
    headings, lists, and inline styles, right in your terminal.

- **Runs Locally**

    No hosted service or additional infrastructure. Reviews are orchestrated on
    your machine using the coding agents you already have configured.

- **Multi-Machine Sync**

    Bi-directionally sync reviews across machines via PostgreSQL.

## Architecture

<img src="/assets/static/architecture.svg" alt="roborev architecture diagram" class="diagram-center" />

- **Daemon**: HTTP server on port 7373 (auto-finds available port if busy)
- **Workers**: Pool of 4 (configurable) parallel review workers
- **Storage**: SQLite at `~/.roborev/reviews.db` with WAL mode
- **Config**: Global at `~/.roborev/config.toml`, per-repo at `.roborev.toml`

## Federated Multiplayer

<img src="/assets/static/federation.svg" alt="roborev federation diagram" class="diagram-center" />

Bi-directionally sync reviews across machines with a shared PostgreSQL database.
Each daemon maintains its local SQLite for fast access while syncing changes to
the central database.
