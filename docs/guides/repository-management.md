Manage repositories tracked by roborev:

```bash
roborev repo list                     # List all repos with review counts
roborev repo show my-project          # Show repo details and stats
roborev repo rename old-name new-name # Rename display name
roborev repo move my-repo .           # Update root path after a directory move
roborev repo delete old-project       # Remove from tracking
roborev repo merge source target      # Merge reviews into another repo
```

## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `repo list` | List all repositories with review counts |
| `repo show <name>` | Show detailed stats for a repository |
| `repo rename <old> <new>` | Rename a repository's display name |
| `repo move <name-or-path> <new-path>` | Update a repository's stored root path on disk |
| `repo delete <name>` | Remove repository from tracking |
| `repo merge <src> <dst>` | Move all reviews to another repo |

## Common Use Cases

### Rename for Clarity

The rename command is useful when you want a friendlier display name than the
directory name:

```bash
roborev repo rename my-project-v2 "My Project"
```

### Moving or Renaming a Repository

If you rename or move a tracked repository's directory on disk (e.g.
`mv ~/code/old-project ~/code/new-project`), use `repo move` to update the
stored root path so existing jobs and reviews stay attached to the same entry:

```bash
# After 'mv old-project new-project', from inside the new directory:
roborev repo move old-project .

# Or specify the new path explicitly:
roborev repo move my-repo /Users/me/code/my-repo

# You can identify the repo by its old (now stale) path too:
roborev repo move /old/path /new/path
```

The first argument can be the database name or the current (or stale) repository
path. The second argument is the new path; `.` resolves to the current
directory's git repository root.

For repos with a git remote, the repository identity stays stable, so the move
is transparent to PostgreSQL sync. For local-only repos, the identity changes to
`local://<new-path>`. If the target path already belongs to another tracked
repo, `repo move` refuses to overwrite it; use `repo merge` to combine the
entries instead.

When you `repo rename` a repository whose stored root path no longer exists on
disk, roborev now hints you toward `repo move` so reviews do not silently desync
from the new directory.

### Consolidate Duplicates

The merge command consolidates duplicate entries (e.g., from symlinks or path
changes):

```bash
# Reviews from /home/user/projects/myapp are stored under "myapp"
# Reviews from /home/user/work/myapp are stored under "myapp-1"
roborev repo merge myapp-1 myapp
```

### Clean Up Old Projects

```bash
roborev repo list                 # See all tracked repos
roborev repo delete old-project   # Remove one you no longer need
```

### Multiple Clones

You can have multiple local clones of the same remote repository (e.g.,
`~/project-main` and `~/project-feature`). Each clone is tracked separately in
roborev while sharing the same repository identity for sync purposes.

When using [PostgreSQL Sync](/advanced/postgres-sync/), reviews from teammates
are intelligently matched:

- If you have exactly one local clone with that identity, synced reviews appear
    there
- If you have multiple clones, a placeholder repo is created to avoid ambiguity

## How Repositories Are Tracked

roborev automatically creates a repository entry when you:

1. Run `roborev init` in a repo
1. Queue a review for a commit in a new repo
1. Run any roborev command in an untracked repo

The default display name is the directory name. You can customize this with:

```toml
# .roborev.toml in your repo
display_name = "My Custom Name"
```

## Git Worktrees

roborev fully supports git worktrees. Reviews are stored against the main
repository, so commits made in any worktree are associated with the same review
history. No configuration is needed.

```bash
# Create a worktree for a feature branch
git worktree add ~/projects/myapp-feature feature-branch
cd ~/projects/myapp-feature

# Reviews work normally, stored under the main repo
roborev review --branch
roborev refine
roborev tui
```

When running commands from a worktree:

- Reviews are stored using the **main repository path** (not the worktree path)
- The post-commit hook registers commits against the main repo root, even from
    linked worktrees
- The TUI shows all reviews for the repository regardless of which worktree
    you're in
- The TUI review screen displays the branch stored with the review, not the
    active worktree branch
- `roborev fix --open` filters to reviews reachable from the current worktree's
    HEAD
- `roborev review --branch` resolves the repository root, branch, and commit
    range from the linked worktree that invoked it, even if shared Git
    configuration points at a sibling checkout
- `refine` correctly finds and addresses reviews for commits in any worktree

### Detached HEAD worktrees

Some tools (agent sandboxes, spec-driven development harnesses) create worktrees
with a detached HEAD, where git reports no current branch. When a commit is made
on detached HEAD, roborev infers the branch for the review: if exactly one local
branch points at the commit it uses that; otherwise, if no branch points at it,
it picks the unique nearest ancestor branch, measured along the commit's
first-parent history — the usual shape when a tool's worktree runs ahead of the
branch it mirrors. If no single best candidate exists (ties, or more than 20
candidate branches), the review is stored without a branch, as before. Inferred
branches respect `excluded_branches`.

Without this, you'd get duplicate repository entries, scattered reviews, and
confusion about which reviews belong to which code. With worktree support,
everything is consolidated under the main repository.

If your repository uses `core.hooksPath` (common with Husky and other hook
managers), roborev resolves relative paths against the main repository root so
the post-commit hook fires correctly from linked worktrees.
